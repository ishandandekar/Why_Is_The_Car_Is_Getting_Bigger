ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to the **Why_Is_The_Car_Getting_Bigger** repository. This is my first tabular data analysis project using Python. Hope you like it!

## Introduction

I did this project to learn the skill of exploratory data analysis. EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is an important step before predicting variables using machine learning. It helps us identify important features using graphical representation, detection of anomalies, testing of hypotheses etc. In other words, EDA is a data exploration technique to understand aspects of data.

In this project I have analysed the accidents occured in USA (United States of America) since 2016-2021, to gain insights and draw conclusions by questioning the data and finding answers.

## Data

The data is originally collected using various APIs that provide streaming by a variety of enities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcemnt agencies, traffi cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Although for this project I have the data already available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). The data has a total of **2.8 million accident records** with **2845342 rows and 47 columns** which was collected from **February 2016** to **December 2021**.  
To get the data on local machine I used the [**`opendatasets`**](https://github.com/JovianML/opendatasets) library, which uses the Kaggle API keys to download the data easily on your system.

## Insights

</p>
The data contained lots of NA values, around 3414350 of them. The analysis was mostly focused on the geolocation of the accidents, weather conditions and severity of an accident.  
While analysing the cities column I found out that Miami had the most number of accidents, followed by Los Angeles and Orlando. These cities are often the places where tourists go. There are around 1000 cities which have reported only 1 accidents. This could indicate missing data. The state of California has the most number of accidents followed by Florida. A high percentage of accidents happen between 3 PM to 5 PM, maybe because the people who work in the day return during this time. Most number of accidents have happened in the weekdays rather than weekends. A lot of data is missing for the year 2020. This could also be because of the pandemic, as people receded from leaving their homes and worked from home. The number of accidents increased at the end of every year. But, they all followed the same pattern throughout. A large number of accidents have been labelled with a severity of 2. There were less number of accidents relatively.

## Contents of the repository

- _assets_: This folder contains the images of plots, python file used for making plots and other supporting material used to make this README file and the Medium article.
- _.gitignore_: This file is used to omit the tracking of unwanted files, so that they are not present in the repository while presenting.
- _analysis.ipynb_: This is the original jupyter notebook used for the analysis. The notebook has three parts, which include donwloading the data, cleaning the data and then finally analysis of data. The notebook also has the original plots which helped the analysis and making the README.
- _README.md_: This is a markdown file which is used to document the project, to make people understand this project better. This file is displayed on the Github repository as well.
- _requirements.txt_: As the convention goes, this file can be used to replicate the `conda` environment used to run the jupyter notebook.
  > :bulb:**Note:** Due to Github's remote repository limits, the folder containing the data was not added. As stated above, if you want to get the data on local machine, you can use the `opendatasets` library or directly donwload the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).

A special thanks to [Aakash Rao N S](https://jovian.ai/aakashns) for this project.
